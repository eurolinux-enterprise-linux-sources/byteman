A simple example showing how to use the Byteman rule check maven plugin.

The plugin is configured in the pom in this directory. It will check
the Byteman script found under the resources directory below
src/test.

The script being tested is taken from the agent integration tests so
the plugin configuration includes an additionalClasspath entry
pointing to the location of the test classes (you will need to have
built the project in order for those classes to be present).

The plugin configuration also specifies package names for the classes
mentioned in the CLASS clause of the test rules. These rules omit the
package qualifier.

The plugin is configured in verbose mode so you will see trace output
showing it searching for rule scripts and checking the rules.

The plugin also specifies failOnError to be true. So, if you edit the
rule and introduce a syntax or type error you should see a maven
failure with a corresponding error message in the output.

To exercise the plugin run

  mvn test
