/**
 * A cache used to allow the association between a class name and the corresponding class in the context
 * of any given class loader to be cached. caching is used to improve performance of the transformer
 * when checking the superclass hierarchy of a class which is a candidate for transformation to identify
 * if it is a target for rules which inject into overriding methods. the cache is a map keyed by classloader
 * whose value is itself a map. each nested map translates a fully qualified class name to an instance of
 * Class. The outer map is a WeakHashMap ensuring that it doe snot hold on to loaders once all references to
 * them have been dropped.
